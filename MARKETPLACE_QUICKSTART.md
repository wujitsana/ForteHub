## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I have my workflow listed multiple times?
**No.** Each workflow has one listing. You can unlist and relist with new price.

### Can I change the price after listing?
**Yes!** Click "Edit" on active listing to update price.

### What happens if I unlist my workflow?
**It returns to your manager.** You can list again anytime, or use it privately.

### Can I buy my own workflow?
**No.** The system prevents buying your own listings.

### How do I earn money from listings?
1. Create a great workflow
2. List it for sale
3. Other users purchase it
4. You receive 98% of sale price
5. See earnings in Dashboard (Phase 2)

### Is my workflow copied or transferred?
**Transferred!** When bought, it's moved from seller's manager to buyer's. Seller no longer has it.

### Can I see who bought my workflow?
**Yes!** Sales history shows all transactions (Phase 3).

### What if I want to keep my workflow private?
**Just don't list it!** Clone the workflow yourself, or keep it unlisted in registry.

### How long does a purchase take?
**2-5 minutes** for transaction to seal on Flow blockchain.

### What if I make a mistake in a transaction?
**Cancel it!** Transactions can be canceled before sealing. After sealing, contact support.
